# What is it?

This repository is both my personal GitHub page, as well as the generator code
that I use to make it.

# How do I use it?

Clone/fork this repo, then copy settings.yaml.tpl to settings.yaml. Edit to match
your needs, then run generator.py

# What do I need to use it?

 - [Python 2.6](http://www.python.org/) (other versions probably work fine)
 - [py-github](http://github.com/dustin/py-github)
 - [PyYAML](http://pyyaml.org/)

# What does the output look like?

Without any changes, it will look like this: [http://jmhobbs.github.com/](http://jmhobbs.github.com/)
